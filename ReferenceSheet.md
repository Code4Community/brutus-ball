# Other Stuff to Do 

## Game Work 
- Expand the game to support anywhere from 2-4 players 
    - Will have to modify functions to work with more than two players 
- More conditional logic based on player state
    - Make it so you can get the other player's coordinates 
- Implement more ways to attack other than just 
- Implement other gamemodes 
    - Battle Royale (7 computers are spawned, player just has to survive) 
        - Will have to modify functions to work with more than two players 
    - Each player tries to be the first one to die
        - Keeps a limitation that you need to shoot at least every fifth iteration or something like that 
- Make the game more customizable
- Make skins for the game 
    - Tanks, Snowballs, Football, etc. 
    
## Interface Work 

- Make the game look better 
    - Don't really have any specific pointers here
- Make the website look better 
    - Please don't make our website look like it was made in the 90s 

## Other 

- Figure out how we plan on actually deploying the website (probably just w/ GitHub pages but we can probably use Netlify or something like that as well)
- Make a reference sheet that we can print out and give to them so they don't have to look our commands up or so we don't have to keep a slide up 
- Put a link to our presentation or to some sort of reference document, etc. on our website
